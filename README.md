# Our Barbershop


### The mission


Invent a company together and think of 1 page per person in your team, that the company needs.
Divide those pages amongst the group and each person designs one page.
Once you are all finished, join those pages together with some form of navigation
Publish the result with a github repository (call it name-of-your-business)
Make sure everyone in the group has a fork of the website
Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there
Add a parallax image header Example
Add a carousel on one page
Mke your website responsive
Mention your phone number somewhere on the onepager, if you click it should (try to) call you
Have a contact form, if you submit it it should send the form to an e-mail address.
You can use bootstrap or SASS, but you are not required to use it. However use of these tools will give you extra credit in the evaluation.

You can choose the make the website in Dutch or English.
