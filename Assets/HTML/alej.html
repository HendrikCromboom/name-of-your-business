            <p class="card-text">
                Situated in one of Antwerp's most iconic areas, Ventura Barbershop opened its doors in the summer of 2011. Created by Hendrik and Cis,
                who wanted to bring back the classic old fashioned barbershop, Ventura has become more than just a place to get your hair cut.
                It's also a place where you can hang out and have a drink before getting a hot towel shave!

                        <p style="text-align: center">One of original founders and with more than 10 years experience in the barbering
                            business, Master Barber Hendrik learned his craft at the Texas Barber College in America. After some years
                            of experience at a local barbershop in Texas he thought it was time to return to the motherland and open
                            a barbershop in his hometown.

                        <p style="text-align: center">A very good friend of Hendrik's and co-founder of Ventura, Cis has been cutting
                            hair for as long as he can remember. He mastered the art of the blade starting at age 14, when he turned
                            his parents' garage into a barbershop where he would cut all his friends' hairs. After a lot of years of
                            experience at Antwerp's best barbershops, he heard of Hendrik's idea and decided to join in.

                                a barber and hairdresser and she has proven to have the most expanded skillset of all. She can can handle
                                all hair types and styles and without her, we wouldn't be able to please our female costumers that prefer
                                a bit more styling.

                                would become the newest member of our team. Like Cis, he started cutting hair at a young age and has not stopped
                                ever since. He's the author of some the most amazing haircuts that you can check out in our gallery. Enjoy!
